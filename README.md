# DeepNet

## Overview

DeepNet is a software platform for how to

- Provide many subsea drones access to network and services (charging, upload of data)
- Enable a Vendor on internet to connect to their drone at the bottom of the sea
- Do the above in an secure, dynamic and automated way

The users of DeepNet are

- Drones
- Humans that own and/or handle drones
- Humans that administrate DeepNet
- IT systems that consume and store data generated by drones,
  - No drone data is kept in DeepNet
  - DeepNet is focused on providing drones a standardized way to upload data to external systems

It is a cross-disciplinary effort that involve

- New hardware on the seabed,
- New (near) autonomous physical things swimming around said hardware on the seabed,
- New physical network components and computers on topside installation connected to seabed installation
- Connecting all of this new stuff to Equinor networks
- And the software to bring them all and in Omnia bind them

## Technologies

### Physical

Offshore and subsea devices at a DeepNet Site

- **Subsea Docking Station (SDS)**
  - Switch
    Provide network between topside and SDS components
  - [Connectors](https://www.bluelogic.no/products/electrical-interfaces/subsea-usb-c-01-500-3000w-)
    Provide
    - Induction charging (MVP)
    - Close proximity wifi (when drone is docked) (one router in each connector part) (MVP)
  - Optical modems (future)
  - Acoustic modems (future)

- **Edge computer**
  ("Edge" = located at a DeepNet Site)
  Topside host for
  - DeepNet Site software
  - SDS control software
  - Have room for additional services as needed

### Digital

- **Omnia**
  For upload of drone data to a yet to be determined location(s)
  - **SLIMM**

- **[Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM)](https://www.linux-kvm.org/)**
  The VM layer that enable the Edge Computer to host all DeepNet Site software and SDS Control software in VMs
